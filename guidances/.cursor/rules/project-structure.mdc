### RPG Ontology Project Structure

This project defines an ontology for Role-Playing Games.

**Key Files and Directories:**

*   **`[tonto.json](mdc:tonto.json)`**: The main project configuration file. It includes metadata such as project name, version, authors, and specifies the output directory.
*   **`[src/](mdc:src)`**: Contains the core ontology source files.
    *   **`[src/all.tonto](mdc:src/all.tonto)`**: This appears to be a central file aggregating or defining major parts of the ontology.
    *   **`[src/world/](mdc:src/world)`**: Likely contains ontology definitions related to the game world, environments, and locations.
    *   **`[src/individual/](mdc:src/individual)`**: Probably holds definitions for characters, NPCs, creatures, or other individual entities.
    *   **`[src/items/](mdc:src/items)`**: Expected to contain definitions for items, equipment, and consumables within the game.
*   **`[out/](mdc:out)`**: The output directory for compiled or generated ontology files, as specified in `[tonto.json](mdc:tonto.json)`.

Understanding these components should help in navigating and modifying the RPG ontology.
